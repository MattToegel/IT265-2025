## Core Gameplay Mechanics

### Primary Mechanics
1. **Five-move combat system** (perfect RPS-5 balance).  
2. **Hidden card selection & simultaneous reveal.**  
3. **Parry system** (same move vs. same move = Parry chain).  
4. **Deck depletion reshuffles** for continuous play.  
5. **Multiplayer & Commander Mode variations.**  

### Goals and Challenges
- **Win duels by reducing the opponent’s HP to 0.**  
- **Use tactical card choices to outplay your opponent.**  
- **Manage deck and hand resources effectively.**  

### Progression
- **1v1 duels are quick (10-15 min).**  
- **Multiplayer/Commander Mode introduces tactical depth.**  
- **Frenzy Mode changes damage output for unpredictability.**  

### Game Rules
1. Players start with **5 cards**.  
2. At the start of each round, players **draw until they have 5 cards**.  
3. Players place **one card face-down**, then **reveal simultaneously**.  
4. The **winning move deals 1 damage** (or rolls 1d6 in Frenzy Mode).  
5. **If a Parry occurs**, both players play another card from their hand.
 - Parries chain indefinitely each adding +1 to the final damage result.  
6. If a player **runs out of cards**, they must **draw from the deck**.  
7. **Repeat until one player/team reaches 0 HP.**

## Treatment Details

### Gameplay Example
**Scenario:**  
1. Player A (Knight A) plays **Slash**, while Player B (Knight B) plays **Impale**.  
2. **Slash beats Impale**, so Player A deals **1 damage**.  
3. Next round, both players select **new cards** to replenish used cards from the prior round.  
4. If they play the **same move**, a **Parry occurs**. 
    - Each Player picks a card from their hand. Repeat until there's a winner.
    - If a hand is expended, the player draws from the top of the deck.
    - Each Parry adds +1 to the final damage total.
5. They continue playing until one player reaches **0 HP**.
