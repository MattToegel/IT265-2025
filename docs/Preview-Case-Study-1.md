# Case Study 1 Preview

## Instructions

1. **Step 1**:  
   From this spreadsheet, pick a game you plan to analyze (selection must be unique) and put your UCID to the left of it:  
   [Game Selection Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ncl4XnA240Jw8kEjbciAbEA4d5MkQkk5tP91zudfhYg/view)  
   If a selection turns red, it has already been chosen. Do not edit others' content/selection and be mindful if multiple people are working on the sheet simultaneously.

2. **Step 2**:  
   Use one of these sites to playtest and analyze your game:  
   - [Free 80s Arcade](https://www.free80sarcade.com/all2600games.php)  
   - [AARP Atari Games](https://games.aarp.org/category/atari-games)  
   - [Keystone Kapers](https://playclassic.games/games/action-atari-2600-games-online/keystone-kapers/play/)  
   - [Triplets and Us](https://www.tripletsandus.com/play-classic-80s-arcade-games/play-atari-2600-video-games/)  

   If none of these work, use an alternative close to the original game.

3. **Step 3**:  
   Analyze and research your chosen game. Collect resources and include them in your responses for related sections.

4. **Step 4**:  
   Save the worksheet, export as a PDF, and upload it to the mentioned branch on GitHub. Create a pull request, merge it to `main`, and upload the PDF to Canvas.
