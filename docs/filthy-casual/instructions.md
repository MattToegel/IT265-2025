## **How to Play**
### **1. Playing a Round**
1. **All players select a card from their hand and place it face-down.**  
2. **Once all players have selected, cards are revealed simultaneously.**  
3. **Resolve the outcome based on the Win/Loss Table:**
   - **Winning move deals 1 damage** (or rolls 1d6 in Frenzy Mode).
   - **Losing players take the damage.**
   - **If both players tie (same move), a Parry occurs.**
4. Used cards are added to a discard pile.

### **2. Parry System**
- **If two players play the same move, a Parry occurs.**
- Each player **selects another card** and plays again.
- If a player **runs out of cards**, they **must draw the top card from the deck**.
- **Each Parry chain adds +1 damage to the final attack.**
- **Parries continue indefinitely** until one player wins.

### **3. End of Round**
- All players **draw a card to refill their hand back to 5**.
- If the deck **runs out**, shuffle the **discard pile** and continue playing.
- The game continues until **one player/team is remaining**.

## **Game Modes**
### **1v1 Standard Mode**
- Players duel **until one reaches 0 HP**.
- Standard **damage, Parry, and deck rules** apply.

### **Multiplayer Modes**
#### **Round-Robin**
- Each player fights the **player to their right** simultaneously.
- Parry and combat resolve normally.
- The winner is the **last player standing**.

#### **Free-for-All (FFA)**
- Each player selects a **target before revealing** their move.
- All interactions resolve based on chosen targets.
- Players **cannot target the same player twice in a row**, ensuring fair play.

#### **Commander Mode (3, 5, or 7 Players)**
- **Each team has 1 Commander** and **Knights on either side**.
- Knights fight their assigned opponent (i.e., the opponent across).
- **The Commander picks ONE enemy Knight to target per round**.
- If a Knight is eliminated, the remaining opponent shifts inward until reaching the Commander.
- **Last surviving team wins.**
- **Commanders play one card to counter multiple attackers.**
    - If a Commander wins against 2+ attackers in a round, they can force a Parry chain against a target attacker.
